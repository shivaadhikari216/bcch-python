Title : Monitoring Aggregation between TDP43-CTD and GRN-7 using Fluorescence
</h1>
<h2>
Background: Mutations in progranulins (PGRN) gene leading to its haploinsufficiency are
strong causative factors related to FTLD. Recently, specific GRN modules have been shown to
directly interact and exacerbate the toxicity of TDP-43. With the help of different biophysical
characterization, our lab has shown the interaction between the pathological C-terminal domain
of TDP-43 (TDP-43 CTD) and GRNs, -3, -5. The results showed that GRN-3 and GRN-5
modulate the aggregation and phase behavior of TDP-43 CTD in different ways. Now, in this
project we are interested in understanding the interaction between GRN-7 with TDP-43 CTD and
which leads us to extend these investigations on GRN-7 and its characterization. Intrinsically
disordered protein (IDP), Granulin-7 shows aggregation when reacted with TDP43-CTD
monitored by fluorescence assay.
